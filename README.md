CyberQuest Academy is a structured, 24-module learning platform that teaches modern cybersecurity and security automation the right way: **authorisation and ethics first, offence only in service of defence, everything in an isolated lab.** It is built with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and deploys automatically to GitHub Pages.

## Who it's for

Beginners who want a safe, legal on-ramp into cybersecurity, and self-learners who want a complete path from fundamentals through to a professional capstone engagement — without ever touching a system they don't own.

## How it's structured

The curriculum runs across five tiers, gated by a mandatory ethics-and-law module:

- **Module 00 — Ethics, Law & Authorisation** (hard gate; the Computer Misuse Act, scope, and rules of engagement)
- **Tier 1 — Foundations** (safe lab setup, Linux, networking, scripting)
- **Tier 2 — Defensive Security** (logging, detection, blue-team fundamentals)
- **Tier 3 — Offensive Security** (lab-only, defensively framed, paired with detection)
- **Tier 4 — Professional & Capstone** (reporting, and a full authorised engagement simulation)

Every practical exercise runs against intentionally vulnerable targets in an **isolated, host-only lab** — never against real or third-party systems.

## Run it locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000.

## Ethos

> Same skills, different ethics. The ethics, the evidence, and the report are what make you a professional.

All offensive content is capped to lab use, framed defensively, and paired with detection. Where skills can be applied for real, the course points only to **legal** outlets: bug bounty programmes, CTFs, certifications, and your own lab.
